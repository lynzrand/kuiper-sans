# Kuiper Sans (ä»®)

Kuiper Sans is a font built from code. The font is inspired by Belleve Invis's [Iosevka][]. Always want to do that. Unsure if this project will ever finish.

The name "Kuiper Sans" is currently a placeholder.

## Building

You will need a relatively new F# compiler to build the font. Other than that, it's just `dotnet run --project Rynco.KuiperSans`.

## Developing

`opentype.js` is used to verify the correctness of the font face output. You will need `pnpm` to install dependencies and `node` to run the verification scripts.

## Shortcuts

If you have `just` installed, you can run:

- `just build` for building
- `just verify` for verifying the output

## License

Please do patiently wait until this thing is at least usable.
